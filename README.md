# CORA

CORA is a Python library for **Combinational Regularity Analysis** (CORA). 

## Description

CORA belongs to the group of Configurational Comparative Methods (CCMs; Thiem *et al*. 2016), and is thus closely related to, 
for example, Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA; Ragin 1987) and Coincidence Analysis (CNA; Baumgartner 2009). 
Unlike QCA and CNA, however, CORA can analyze multi-output structures without generating redundancies. In addition, 
CORA offers a data-mining approach to solution building that reduces model ambiguities by keeping the number of required 
variables for finding a solution at a minimum. Lastly, CORA includes a standardized visualization module called LOGIGRAM, 
with which logic diagrams can be produced from (systems of) Boolean functions in disjunctive normal form.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install CORA.

```bash
pip install CORA
```
